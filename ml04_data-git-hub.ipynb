    "### Introduction\n",
    "The objective of the Mushroom Classification problem is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical and chemical characteristics. The dataset includes descriptions of 23 species of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families. These mushrooms are classified as definitely edible or definitely poisonous (including those with unknown edibility, which were grouped into the poisonous category). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other biological classifications, there is no simple rule (such as \"leaflets three, let it be\" for poison ivy) to determine a mushroom’s safety. Instead, various morphological and chemical features must be analyzed, making machine learning a valuable tool for automating classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will involve: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (such as \"is cap color white?\"). It works like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Easy to interpret and fast to train. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Can overfit if the tree becomes too complex. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Support Vector Machine (SVM) finds the best boundary (a hyperplane) to separate edible and poisonous mushrooms. It is effective in handling non-linear relationships through the use of different kernel functions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Works well with complex data and is effective when a clear margin of separation exists. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for large datasets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network (NN)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Neural Network is inspired by how the human brain processes information. It consists of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that process input data and learn patterns. Given the dataset’s complexity, a neural network may identify subtle relationships between mushroom characteristics and toxicity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Can capture complex patterns and non-linear relationships. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting and may need more training data. <br>\n"

    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

    "When reviewing the mushroom dataset, I noticed that all the features are categorical, which means that I will need to encode them properly before applying machine learning models. The dataset contains various characteristics of mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, odor, and other physical attributes, which will be useful in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. One issue I found is the presence of missing or ambiguous values. Some columns contain question marks, which likely represent missing data that will need to be handled appropriately. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since all the features are categorical, I need to ensure that the encoding method preserves the meaningful relationships between values without introducing bias. Another potential issue is class imbalance, which could affect model performance if one class significantly outnumbers the other. Before proceeding with modeling, I will need to explore the distribution of classes and handle any missing or erroneous values to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing `unique_values_output.txt`, I identified additional data cleaning and transformation opportunities. Some categorical variables could be simplified or grouped to reduce complexity while retaining meaningful distinctions. Additionally, certain columns contain values that could be converted into boolean features, which might improve model interpretability and efficiency. Implementing these transformations will help create a more diverse dataset that allows machine learning models to extract better patterns from the data. <br>"
