    "### Introduction\n",
    "The objective of the Mushroom Classification problem is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical and chemical characteristics. The dataset includes descriptions of 23 species of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families. These mushrooms are classified as definitely edible or definitely poisonous (including those with unknown edibility, which were grouped into the poisonous category). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other biological classifications, there is no simple rule (such as \"leaflets three, let it be\" for poison ivy) to determine a mushroom’s safety. Instead, various morphological and chemical features must be analyzed, making machine learning a valuable tool for automating classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will involve: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (such as \"is cap color white?\"). It works like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Easy to interpret and fast to train. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Can overfit if the tree becomes too complex. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Support Vector Machine (SVM) finds the best boundary (a hyperplane) to separate edible and poisonous mushrooms. It is effective in handling non-linear relationships through the use of different kernel functions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Works well with complex data and is effective when a clear margin of separation exists. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for large datasets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network (NN)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Neural Network is inspired by how the human brain processes information. It consists of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that process input data and learn patterns. Given the dataset’s complexity, a neural network may identify subtle relationships between mushroom characteristics and toxicity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Can capture complex patterns and non-linear relationships. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting and may need more training data. <br>\n"

    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

The dataset contains various characteristics of mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, odor, and other physical attributes, which will be useful in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. One issue I found is the presence of missing or ambiguous values. Some columns contain question marks, which likely represent missing data that will need to be handled appropriately. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "When handling missing values and cleaning the data, I need to first determine where the gaps exist and how they might impact the analysis. Since this dataset consists entirely of categorical data, missing values should be treated carefully to avoid introducing bias or losing valuable information. One approach is to replace missing values with the most frequently occurring category in a given column, ensuring that the imputed values align with the overall distribution of the dataset. This is particularly useful for features where missing values are scattered and do not represent a significant portion of the data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if a column contains an excessive number of missing values, removing the column entirely might be the best option to prevent introducing unreliable information. I need to establish a reasonable threshold to determine whether a feature is worth keeping. If a column is missing more than 40% of its values, I may consider dropping it instead of attempting to impute it. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some missing values may indicate a meaningful distinction rather than an actual gap. For example, if missing values appear in the stalk-root column, it could suggest that certain mushrooms naturally lack a defined root structure. In such cases, it may be beneficial to create a new category to label missing values explicitly rather than imputing or dropping them. <br>\n",

Since the stalk-root column has a large proportion of missing values, imputing them with the most frequent value or using domain knowledge might be the best option. <br>\n",

Since all features in the mushroom dataset are categorical, traditional numerical outlier detection methods (such as using Z-scores or the IQR method) are not applicable.

This transformation helps ensure the dataset remains balanced and prevents bias in the classification process. <br>\n",
