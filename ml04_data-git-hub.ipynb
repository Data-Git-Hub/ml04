    "### Introduction\n",
    "The objective of the Mushroom Classification problem is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical and chemical characteristics. The dataset includes descriptions of 23 species of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families. These mushrooms are classified as definitely edible or definitely poisonous (including those with unknown edibility, which were grouped into the poisonous category). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other biological classifications, there is no simple rule (such as \"leaflets three, let it be\" for poison ivy) to determine a mushroom’s safety. Instead, various morphological and chemical features must be analyzed, making machine learning a valuable tool for automating classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will involve: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Decision Tree splits data into smaller groups based on decision rules (such as \"is cap color white?\"). It works like a flowchart, where each decision point leads to another question until a final classification is reached. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Easy to interpret and fast to train. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Can overfit if the tree becomes too complex. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Support Vector Machine (SVM) finds the best boundary (a hyperplane) to separate edible and poisonous mushrooms. It is effective in handling non-linear relationships through the use of different kernel functions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Works well with complex data and is effective when a clear margin of separation exists. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for large datasets. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network (NN)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    A Neural Network is inspired by how the human brain processes information. It consists of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that process input data and learn patterns. Given the dataset’s complexity, a neural network may identify subtle relationships between mushroom characteristics and toxicity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Can capture complex patterns and non-linear relationships. <br>\n",
    "    Weaknesses: Requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting and may need more training data. <br>\n"
